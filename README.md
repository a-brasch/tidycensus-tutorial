tidycensus R package tutorial

As noted by its author, Kyle Walker, `tidycensus` is an R package that allows users to interface with the US Census Bureau's decennial Census and American Community Survey (ACS) APIs and return tidyverse-ready data frames, optionally with simple feature (sf) geometry included.

This tutorial outlines some of the basic functionality of `tidycensus`.
